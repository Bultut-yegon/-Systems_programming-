Subproblems and Order of Implementation:
Define the Data Structure:

Define a struct for storing contact information.
Define an array of this structure to hold up to 12 contacts.
Testing: Verify that the structure is defined correctly and that an array of these structures can be created.
Initialize the Contact List:

Initialize the array to store up to 12 contacts.
Maintain a count of the current number of contacts.
Testing: Print the initialized array and count to ensure proper setup.
Add a Contact:

Implement a function to add a contact to the list.
Check for available space before adding.
Testing: Add several contacts and print the list to verify correct addition.
Delete a Contact:

Implement a function to delete a contact by a specific criterion (e.g., first name and last name).
Shift the remaining contacts in the array to fill the gap.
Testing: Add and delete contacts, then print the list to ensure correct deletion and shifting.
Update a Contact:

Implement a function to update the contact information of an existing contact.
Identify the contact by a specific criterion and update the fields.
Testing: Add, update, and display contacts to verify correct updating.
Display Contacts:

Implement a function to display all current contacts.
Iterate through the list and print the contact details.
Testing: Add multiple contacts and display them to ensure correct display.
User Interface:

Implement a menu-driven interface to allow the user to add, delete, update, and display contacts.
Use a loop to display the menu options and call the corresponding functions based on user input.
Testing: Test the entire program by adding, deleting, updating, and displaying contacts through the user interface.
